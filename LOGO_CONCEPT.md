## Logo Concept 1: Minimalist LED Grid "D"

### Description
A stylized letter "D" formed by LED dots in a 5x7 grid pattern, with some dots glowing bright and others dim (showing the authentic LED look). The "D" represents "DotMatrix" and the LED aesthetic.

### Visual Style
- **Grid**: 5x7 LED dot matrix
- **Active LEDs**: Bright green (#00ff00) with glow
- **Inactive LEDs**: Dim green (#00ff00 at 8-15% opacity) to show grid structure
- **Background**: Deep black (#000000) or dark gray (#0a0a0a)
- **Glow Effect**: Subtle blur/glow around active LEDs

### AI Prompt
```
Create a minimalist logo for a LED dot matrix ticker app called "DotMatrix". 
Design a stylized letter "D" using a 5x7 grid of circular LED dots on a deep black background. 
The active LEDs forming the "D" should be bright neon green (#00ff00) with a subtle glow effect. 
The inactive LEDs should be visible but dim (8-15% opacity) to show the grid structure. 
Style: retro-futuristic, digital, clean, modern. 
Vector-style, scalable, high contrast. 
No text, just the LED grid pattern.
```

### Variations
- **Square format**: Perfect for app icons (512x512)
- **Wide format**: For headers/banners (16:9 ratio)
- **Monochrome**: White LEDs on black for dark mode
- **Color variants**: Red, blue, amber, or white LEDs instead of green

## Logo Concept 2: Scrolling Text Effect

### Description
A small LED matrix display showing the word "DOT" or "DM" scrolling from right to left, with a few characters visible. Captures the scrolling ticker essence of the app.

### Visual Style
- **Grid**: 5x7 or 7x5 LED matrix
- **Text**: "DOT" or "DM" in LED font
- **Animation feel**: Static image but suggests motion
- **Frame**: Optional subtle border/frame around the display

### AI Prompt
```
Design a logo showing a LED dot matrix display with the word "DOT" scrolling from right to left. 
The display should be a 5x7 grid of circular LED bulbs on a dark background. 
The letters should be formed by bright green (#00ff00) LEDs with glow effects. 
Show partial characters to suggest scrolling motion. 
Include a subtle dark frame around the display. 
Style: retro digital, authentic LED ticker look, high contrast.
Vector-style, scalable.
```

## Logo Concept 3: Abstract Grid Pattern

### Description
An abstract pattern of LED dots forming a geometric shape or wave pattern, representing the grid structure and data flow. More modern and less literal.

### Visual Style
- **Pattern**: Geometric grid with selective LED activation
- **Shape**: Could form a wave, circuit pattern, or abstract symbol
- **Colors**: Green LEDs with varying intensity
- **Background**: Deep black

### AI Prompt
```
Create an abstract logo using a LED dot matrix grid pattern. 
Design a geometric or wave-like pattern using circular LED dots in a grid formation. 
Use bright green (#00ff00) LEDs with glow effects for the active pattern, 
and dim green dots (10% opacity) for the background grid. 
Deep black background. 
Style: modern, abstract, tech-forward, minimalist. 
Vector-style, scalable, suitable for app icon.
```

## Logo Concept 4: Wordmark + Icon Combination

### Description
A combination logo with a small LED grid icon (letter "D" or abstract pattern) next to the word "DotMatrix" rendered in a digital/LED-style font.

### Visual Style
- **Icon**: Small LED grid (32-48px)
- **Wordmark**: "DotMatrix" in a digital font (like LED matrix font or tech font)
- **Layout**: Horizontal (icon left, text right) or stacked (icon top, text bottom)
- **Colors**: Green LEDs + white/green text

### AI Prompt
```
Design a combination logo with a LED dot matrix icon and wordmark. 
Left side: A small 5x7 LED grid forming a stylized "D" in bright green (#00ff00) with glow. 
Right side: The word "DotMatrix" in a digital/LED-style font, white or green color. 
Deep black background. 
Style: retro-futuristic, tech-forward, professional. 
Vector-style, scalable. 
Horizontal layout.
```
